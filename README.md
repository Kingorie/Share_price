# Share price Scraper

This is a Python program that gets the current stock prices of shares trading at the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE).
The program then stores the prices in a table in an excel file.

# Objective

While there is access to intrad-day live data, historical data is hard to come by. 
Using Selenium web driver for chrome, this script launches a headless browser and then scrapes all the relevant share details.

# How it works

1. Download your appropriate chromedriver and save it to this repository
2. Run "All Cells" on ipynb file. A .csv file is created for this date. Script overwrites previous file
